         <strong>As a recent high school graduate, I'm interested in:</strong>
      <ul>
          <li>Learning new things from experienced web developers.</li>
          <li>Growing my knowledge every day.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>About Liz</h2>
        
          <p class="center-text"> I graduated high school the year the pandemic happened, I was at a loss at what to do with my life. I didn't want to attend college if I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in the future. So I took a gap year exploring potential career options and once I discovered coding, I fell in love. That's what led me to become a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>. In my free time, I love to go hiking, kayaking, and paddleboarding.</p>
