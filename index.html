            <h2>About Liz</h2>
        
          <p> After I graduated highschool, I was at a loss at what to do with my life. I didn't want to attend college if I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in the future. So I took a some time exploring ideas on what I would want a career in and once I discovered coding, I fell in love. That's what led me to become a student at <strong>thinkful</strong>. In my free time I love to go hiking, kayaking, and paddleboarding.</p>
